# LeetCode-Programming-Problems

I've been practicing coding problems on Leetcode.com which involve algorithms and data structures. I've been learning Python3 as well so I thought this might be a best place to document what I've done so far and explain my solutions in detail.

I can code in PHP, Java, C#, JavaScript and Python and use whichever fits the project best. For learning purposes, Python code is fairly easy to test locally, so most of the code here. I'd love to get feedback for improvement (on code syntax, data structures, etc).
